# [A deep dive on Angular decorators](https://ultimatecourses.com/blog/angular-decorators)
##  Decorators Angular Offers:
* Class decorators, e.g. `@component` and `@NgModule`  
* Property decorators, e.g. `@Input` and `@Output`  
* Method decorators, e.g. `@HostListener`
* Parameter decorators for parameters inside class constructors, e.g. `@Inject`
## Decorators are actually just functions, its as simple as that, and are called with whatever they are decorating.
